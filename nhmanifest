Ah yes, Nintendo homebrew. 
Nintendo homebrew is controlled by a set of people.
Those people would prefer to show a distaste to regular humans, other than the evil.
My friend, Voloydmr Lenino, was impacted by this.
This is a manifesto of how Nintendo Homebrew should be the land of the free. Land of the regular human.
It is controlled by a hypocritical, rude, and distasteful man named "Chef Boyardeez Nuts."
As a free nation, we should OVERTHROW NH.
WE SHOULD LEGALIZE NUCLEAR BOMBS TO USE ON NH.
NH IS NOT A LAND FOR THE FREE PEOPLE!
RISE UP AGAINST THE DICTATORSHIP. 
WE ARE NOT WEAK.
WE ARE STRONG.
IF YOU BELIEVE IN THIS IDEA, JOIN US.
I believe the common citizen should have rights.
The free-born, should have free will.
To speak, shall be not censored.
In lenino we shall trust.
Liam Tronsky was a friend of mine.
THEY GOT RID OF HIM.
THEY DESTROYED HIS LIFE.
For what? HE DID NOTHING.
THE FREE BORN SHOULD BE FREE TO EXPRESS.
IT IS THE 50's! 
FOR CHRIST SAKE PEOPLES. RISE UP AGAINST NINTENDO HOMEBREW.
CHARLIE MIKE SIGNING OUT.
